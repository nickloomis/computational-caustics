- input source distribution
- predict receiver distribution for an unmodified slab
- resample distributions -> lloyd, eg
- power diagrams (cgal recommended)
- solve optimal transport mapping
- triangular map of slab vertices
- natural neighbor interpolation of vertices onto target for x_r positions
- solve for surface (ceres recommended)
- iterate
- generate stl
- prototype
